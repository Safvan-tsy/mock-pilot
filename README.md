# MockPilot Browser Extension

An AI-powered browser extension that automatically fills out forms with contextually appropriate data. Perfect for developers and testers who need to populate forms

Browser extension that uses AI to intelligently autofill forms, based on contextual cues like:

 * input field names
 * placeholder, label, title, aria-*, etc.
 * surrounding text or section headers

The user connects their own AI API key (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, etc.), and once the extension is enabled, it uses the DOM structure and semantic clues to generate appropriate, clean sample data.
